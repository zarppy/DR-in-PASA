electricity consumption: First results},

   abstract = {In Brazil, the electricity consumption of the commercial class has been growing more than the consumption of the other classes, e.g. residential, industrial, and others. Understanding why this is happening and how it would progress is essential for policy makers and for agents of the electrical sector. Bottom-up models consider a detailed and disaggregated representation of a region’s economy, and allow the incorporation of technological
changes and policy impacts in its forecasts. In this context, the paper presents the first results of the long-term bottom-up modelling of Brazilian commercial class electricity consumption. The bottom-up model used in this work is the FORECAST model adapted for Brazil. It differentiates the five regions of the country, 8 subsectors of the tertiary sector, and 14 building and end user related energy services, such as lighting in buildings, street lighting, ventilation and air conditioning, and others. Despite the lack of consolidated information at the required level of disaggregation in Brazil, the first results show proximity to the official long-term forecasts. The results are analyzed and discussed.},

   note = {DP may help tackling the demand, but little consensus in the degree of the responsiveness, no occurance in the appropriate choice of pricing plans.

   abstract = {Dynamic pricing of electricity is receiving growing attention as a key enabler of the smart grid and a solution for promoting grid resilience to increasing penetration of renewable sources. Despite various dynamic pricing programs are contemplated and actively implemented by utilities in many developed economies, corporate decision makers are not aware of the extent to which their businesses can adapt to the programs and its associated risks and opportunities. This study investigates the demand response of commercial and industrial businesses to the Korean critical peak pricing pilot which was implemented in the winter of 2013. The demand responses of 802 businesses covering 34 commercial and industrial categories are evaluated and characterized by constructing their individual baseline loads. The results
resoundingly confirm substantial differences in demand response across and within the segments, with the magnitude of response closely correlated with the firms' expenditure shares of electricity. It is thus suggested that conventional business classification is not sufficient enough to characterize firms' demand response to dynamic pricing plans, calling for firm-level, data-based approaches to consumer segmentation and electricity services. This study also identifies two important types of response behavior to which due attention has not been paid: shortterm learning effect d that is, the demand responsiveness increasing with CPP event experiences d and seemingly inefficient behavior of preparatory and recovering reductions in off-peak hours neighboring critical peak hours.},

   abstract = {The energy price system in Beijing has not fully exploited customers’ price elasticity, and has a negative impact on achieving the goals of energy saving. This paper analyses the response behaviours of different customers to typical energy prices. As for electricity self-elasticity, the range of the primary, secondary, tertiary industry and residents are −0.026 to −0.033, −0.045 to −0.059, −0.035 to −0.047 and −0.024 to −0.032, respectively. As regards self-elasticity on coal, the range of the primary, secondary, tertiary industry and residents are −0.030 to −0.037, −0.066 to −0.093, −0.055 to −0.072 and −0.034 to −0.051, respectively. The self-elasticities on oil and natural gas are very weak. As for cross-elasticity, when consuming electricity and oil, customers mainly focus on the prices of natural gas, which are 0.185 and 0.112. When consuming coal and natural gas, customers are concerned about the electricity prices, and their cross-elasticities are 0.03 and 0.36, respectively. The estimation of demand response to energy price signals in energy consumption behaviours can provide a decision support for formulating rational energy price policies.},

   abstract = {Efficient delivery of network services and the electricity infrastructure to meet the long-term consumer's interests are the main objectives and the strategies of a national electricity market, while the main interests of generators are to maximize their profit through pricing strategies. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore whether electricity prices across the four Australian States display symmetric price volatility connectedness. The study is the first attempt in the literature to make use of intraday 5-min Australian dispatch electricity prices, spanning the period December 8th, 1998 to May 5th, 2016 to quantify asymmetries in volatility connectedness emerging from good, and bad volatility. The results provide supportive evidence that the Australian electricity markets are connected asymmetrically implying the presence of some degree of market power that is exercised by generators across regional electricity markets.},

   abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is a well-known concept which has been recognized as an increasingly valuable tool to provide flexibility to the power system, to support the integration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) resources and to manage the grid more efficiently. In recent years, there have been a growing number of publications focusing on the estimation of different categories of DR potentials (e.g. theoretical, technical, economic, and achievable) using different methodologies and assumptions in each research study. The contribution of the present study is twofold. Firstly, a literature review is undertaken focusing specifically on the categorization of the scientific approaches used to estimate the different categories of DR potentials. To the best of authors' knowledge, a general procedure for the estimation of each DR potential category is still missing. Therefore, a novel user-friendly and step-by-step theoretical framework for the determination of the different categories of DR potentials is presented. Findings of this study reveal that literature has extensively focused on the estimation of the technical DR potential followed by the economic, theoretical and achievable potentials respectively. A lack of understanding of the different categories of DR potentials was also identified, which sometimes have been unduly used in the literature. The proposed framework is supported on a small sample of numerical approaches and equations which results in a structured approach to bringing consensus to the DR potential assessment.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a new method for estimating the demand response potential of residential air conditioning (A/C), using hourly electricity consumption data (“smart meter” data) from 30,000 customer accounts in Northern California. We apply linear regression and unsupervised classification methods to hourly, whole-home consumption and outdoor air temperature data to determine the hours, if any, that each home׳s A/C is active, and the temperature dependence of consumption when it is active. When results from our sample are scaled up to the total population, we find a maximum of 270–360MW (95\% c.i.) of demand response potential over a 1-h duration with a 4°F setpoint change, and up to 3.2–3.8GW of short-term curtailment potential. The estimated resource correlates well with the evening decline of solar production on hot, summer afternoons, suggesting that demand response could potentially act as reserves for the grid during these periods in the near future with expected higher adoption rates of solar energy. Additionally, the top 5\% of homes in the sample represent 40\% of the total MW-hours of DR resource, suggesting that policies and programs to take advantage of this resource should target these high users to maximize cost-effectiveness.},

This paper presents such a model (named K-SVR). While yielding prediction accuracy comparable with the best known models in the literature, K-SVR requires a significantly reduced computational time. The computational reduction is attained by eliminating the use of a feature selection process, which is commonly used by the existing models in the literature. K-SVR is a hybrid model that combines clustering algorithms, support vector machine, and support vector regression. K-SVR is tested using Pennsylvania–New Jersey–Maryland market data from the periods 2005–6, 2011–12, and 2014–15. Market data from 2006 has been used to measure performance of many of the existing models. Authors chose these models to compare performance and demonstrate strengths of K-SVR. Results obtained from K-SVR using the market data from 2012 and 2015 are new, and will serve as benchmark for future models.},

   abstract = {Due to the integration of intermittent resources of power generation such as wind and solar, the amount of supplied electricity will exhibit unprecedented fluctuations. Electricity retailers can partially meet the challenge of matching demand and volatile supply by shifting power demand according to the fluctuating supply side. The necessary technology infrastructure such as Advanced Metering Infrastructures for this so-called Demand Response (DR) has advanced. However, little is known about the economic dimension and further effort is strongly needed to realistically quantify the financial impact. To succeed in this goal, we derive an optimization problem that minimizes procurement costs of an electricity retailer in order to control Demand Response usage. The evaluation with historic data shows that cost volatility can be reduced by 7.74\%; peak costs drop by 14.35\%; and expenditures of retailers can be significantly decreased by 3.52\%.},

When integrated into electricity markets, Demand Response can be used for load shifting and as a replacement for both control reserve and balancing energy. These three usage scenarios are compared based on historic German data from 2011 to determine that load shifting provides the highest benefit: its annual financial savings accumulate to €3.110M for both households and the service sector. This equals to relative savings of 2.83\% compared to a scenario without load shifting. To improve Demand Response integration, the proposed model suggests policy implications: reducing bid sizes, delivery periods and the time-lag between market transactions and delivery dates in electricity markets.},

In energy systems mainly relying on photovoltaic and wind power, DR may furthermore contribute to system stability and increase the renewable energy share. In this paper, an assessment of the theoretical DR potential in Europe is presented. Special attention is given to temporal availability and geographic distribution of flexible loads. Based on industrial production and electricity consumption statistics, as well as periodic and temperature-dependent load profiles, possible load reduction and increase is estimated for each hour of the year. The analysis identifies substantial DR potentials in all consumer sectors. They add up to a minimum load reduction of 61 GW and a minimum load increase of 68 GW, available in every hour of the year. The overall potential features significant variations during the year, which are characteristic for specific consumers and countries.},

   abstract = {The activation of demand response (DR) potentials offered by electricity consumer flexibility is one promising option for providing balancing power and energy in supply systems with high share of variable renewable energy (VRE) power generation. In this paper, a model-based assessment of the economic DR potential in Germany is presented. It relies on the extension of the REMix energy system model by flexible electric loads. In a case study considering a future German power supply system with a VRE share of 70\%, possible cost reductions achieved by investment in DR are quantified. The sensitivity of the results to changes in the assumed DR costs and characteristics are analyzed in additional simulations. The results show that the major benefit of employing DR is its ability to substitute peak power generation capacity, whereas the impact on the integration of VRE power generation is lower. This implies that the focus of DR is on the provision of power, not energy. Even at rather pessimistic cost DR assumptions, more than 5GW of power plant capacity can be substituted. Consumer flexibility furthermore triggers an increase in the operation of back-up power plants, whereas it decreases the utilization of pumped storage hydro stations. In the model results, the reductions in annual power supply costs achieved by DR add up to several hundreds of millions of Euros.},

   journal = {Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews},
   volume = {72},
   pages = {57-72},
   abstract = {Demand for flexibility in electricity systems and the transition to the Smart Grid is increasing opportunities for demand response (DR). However, there are many barriers which prevent the full potential of DR being realised. Unlocking of this potential, through identification of DR enablers, can be aided through systematic classification and analysis of DR barriers. To this end, while previous works mostly focused on individual aspects, this paper develops a comprehensive ‘socio-techno-economic’ review, classification and analysis of DR barriers and enablers in a Smart Grid context. This provides an intellectual framework which may be used to underpin further work on the study and integration of DR. DR barriers are classified as either fundamental (i.e., relating to intrinsic human nature/essential enabling technology) or secondary (i.e., relating to anthropogenic institutions/or system feedbacks). Fundamental barriers are defined as economic, social or technological, whilst secondary barriers relate to political regulatory aspects, design of markets, physical (electrical network) issues, or to general understanding of DR. Subsequently, associated enablers for the defined barriers are suggested. Consideration of technical and commercial/social aspects for both power system and information and communication technology (the “internet of things”) domains provides a foundational contribution to improve understanding of DR within the Smart Grid paradigm. Finally, the complexity resulting from connections between various barriers, enablers and the energy system generally, and the existence of the signature characteristics of complex systems is acknowledged and implications discussed.},

   abstract = {Increasing levels of variable renewable energy require additional flexible resources in the global energy system. In countries with energy-intensive industries, flexibility may be increased through industrial demand side management (IDSM). In most studies, the potential of IDSM is estimated from a technical or theoretical viewpoint. However, IDSM capacity is only utilized if the industry finds it profitable, and thus the economic potential should also be assessed. The focus of this paper is on the intra-day IDSM potential of a paper mill site that is active in the Nordic power market. An optimization model is built to estimate the costs that occur when the paper mill executes regulating power bids, if the original production schedule has been optimized against a spot price forecast. The costs are estimated for different sizes of bids and a marginal cost curve is provided for pricing them. Using this marginal cost curve, the market potential of the case mill site is assessed. It is found that this potential is greatly influenced by the costs of executing regulating power bids. The results indicate that transmission system operators and policy makers should account for economic factors when assessing the potential of market based IDSM.},

   abstract = {Active load shifting of the electricity demand unlocks a variety of benefits. Examples of such advantages include the increased stability of energy systems, reduced electricity costs and financial savings in the transmission as well as generation infrastructure. Although the technology necessary for demand response has been extensively studied for individual appliances or at the micro-grid level, evaluations of its nationwide impact are scarce. Yet governments and policy-makers require quantitative assessments in order to understand the underlying value and derive appropriate policies. For this purpose, this paper utilizes real-world data from the German-Austrian electricity market in order to calculate ex post the impact of demand response on electricity spot prices and load. As a result, we find that a 25\% adoption rate of the available potential for load shifting could have decreased nationwide electricity expenses by approximately €500million, or 6\%, in 2014. At the same time, we observe that the price volatility rises under this scheme and thus impairs non-flexible electricity customers. This observation entails significant implications in terms of designing effective policies.},

   abstract = {The aim of this work is to develop a demand-side-response model, which assists electricity consumers exposed to the market price to independently and proactively manage air-conditioning peak electricity demand. The main contribution of this research is to show how consumers can optimize the energy cost caused by the air conditioning load considering to several cases e.g. normal price, spike price, and the probability of a price spike case. This model also investigated how air-conditioning applies a pre-cooling method when there is a substantial risk of a price spike. The results indicate the potential of the scheme to achieve financial benefits for consumers and target the best economic performance for electrical generation distribution and transmission. The model was tested with Queensland electricity market data from the Australian Energy Market Operator and Brisbane temperature data from the Bureau of Statistics regarding hot days from 2011 to 2012.},

   abstract = {This report reviews the current status of European Member States’ regulation supporting Demand Response and Aggregation in the wholesale, balancing and ancillary electricity markets, as stipulated in Article 15 of the Energy Efficiency Directive.
Demand Response is able to increase the system’s adequacy and to substantially reduce the need for investment in peaking generation by shifting consumption away from times of high demand. It can act as a cost effective balancing resource for variable renewable generation. Adding stability to the system, it lowers the need for coal and gas fired spinning reserves – most running power plants burn fuel continuously in order to be ready to supply power at short notice. It furthermore decreases the need for local network investments, as it shifts consumption away from peak hours in regions with tight network capacity. Demand Response delivers these benefits by providing consumers – residential, commercial or industrial – with control signals and/or financial incentives to adjust their consumption at strategic times.
New insights on key success criteria for Demand Response which are in line with and benefit from, Europe’s competitive market design are discussed in the report. A unique European Model begins to emerge. Positive developments in Member States have been evaluated and those who have looked to enable Demand Response are succeeding, despite continued barriers and remaining issues.},

   title = {Bidding strategy in energy and spinning reserve markets for aluminum smelters' demand response},
   publisher = {2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)},
   abstract = {Aluminum smelting is an energy-intensive electrolytic process that is widely used to produce aluminum. The electricity cost thereby constitutes a significant portion of the total operation cost. At the same time, the smelting process is able to change its power consumption both accurately and quickly by controlling the pots' DC voltage, without affecting the production quality. Hence, an aluminum smelter has both the motivation and the ability to participate in demand-side management. By bidding into the electricity market, the smelter provides flexibility to the power system operator and gets compensation which reduces the overall electricity cost. In this paper, we focus on determining the optimal bidding strategy in the day-ahead energy and spinning reserve markets for an aluminum smelter. The approach is based on stochastic programming in which the market prices are the stochastic variables. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and provide insights into the demand-side management for industrial plants.},
